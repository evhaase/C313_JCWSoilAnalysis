1) Importing the Data
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=TRUE}
#Import ICPMS data -> find path by right clicking on data file (already uploaded in R and selecting "import dataset")
ICPMS_imported <- read.csv("~/R/C313_JCWSoilAnalysis/Data/ICPMS_Data.csv", skip=1, na="N/A") 

#Import ICPMS data -> find path by right clicking on data file (already uploaded in R and selecting "import dataset")

2) Tidying the RSD Data
```{r Tidying RSD Data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
RSD_data<-ICPMS_imported %>%
  #first the RSD columns are selected
  #and renamed with the appropriate metal isotope
  select(Cr52 = CPS.RSD,

         Cd114 = CPS.RSD.4,
         Pb208 = CPS.RSD.5,
         Ge_RSD = CPS.RSD.7,
         Sample.Key)%>%
  #The sample key is also selected for later use in verifying
  #that the RSD data is properly matching the CPS data
  #then the newly renamed RSD columns are gathered together
  #a column is created to indicate which metal corresponds to which RSD
  pivot_longer(1:6,
